* Towers of Hanoi - The classic game of Hanoi tower consists of a stack of wooden disks of various, unique size and three axes. At the beginning of the game, all disks are stacked on the left axis, in decreasing size (largest disk at the bottom). The goal of the game is to move the entire stack to the right axis, moving one disk at a time and always placing a disk on an empty stack or a larger disk.

* Spiral - Using a premade grid class, make a spiral class that can print the grid as it would appear in a spiral pattern.
